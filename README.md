# T-shaped-interaction
A code to detect T-shaped interactions in RNA.
The code works on Python3.
To run the code in a terminal go through the following steps.
1. Download the whole code into a folder
3. Unzip the "utils" folder and keep it in main folder
3. Create a subfolder (eg PDBfiles) and store the target PDB structurs into it.
4. In the terminal run the code 
    by >>>Python run_stacking.py PDBfile/
This will create files for each PDB structure in the PDBfiles folder.
5. To consolidate all the data into a single text files
         >>>Python consolidate_stack.py PDBfile/
   
   
   
   Note: You may need to install modules like numpy and inf which can be done using "pip install numpy" and "pip intsall inf" in your terminal before you run the code
